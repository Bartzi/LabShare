Hi {{reservation.user.username}},

The GPU you reserved at LabShare is now available for you to use until {{reservation.usage_expires|date:'l jS F Y'}} at {{reservation.usage_expires|date:'H:i'}}.
You reserved the GPU {{gpu.model_name}} belonging to {{gpu.device.name}}.
You can extend your reservation 48 hours before it expires (you will get a reminder to do so).

Best Regards,
LabShare
