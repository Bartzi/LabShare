Hi {{reservation.user.username}},

a GPU you reserved at LabShare is expiring on {{reservation.usage_expires|date:'l jS F Y'}} at {{reservation.usage_expires|date:'H:i'}} (in about 48 hours).
You can extend your reservation until that time at LabShare.
Otherwise the reservation will be removed by the system automatically at that time.
This affects the GPU {{gpu.model_name}} belonging to {{gpu.device.name}}.

Best Regards,
LabShare
